# LineOfSight
As part of my applied algorithms course in my master's program, I wrote a python program that randomnly generates walls as line segments and agents as points in 2D space. We then determine wether a line of sight exists between any two agents in O(m) where m are the number of walls. We achieve this by represting our world in binary space partition.
